import SwiftUI

///some means one specific type of view has to be return
///VIEW comes from swiftUI, which is the basic protocol to display anything on the screen
///Forms converts the layout in to list order like the settings in iOS
///we can use upto 10 lists in one form but if we need to use more list we need to group them
///NavigationBar here called Navigation View.
///state is the property wrapper that let us modify the value
///$ sign reads and writes the value for any State property
///Changes will be reflected in real time
///ForEach loop is used for iteration in SwiftUI.
///SwiftUI pickerview controller uses the ForEach loop to pick or displays the values.
///2 in the numberOfPeople means that the picker will select the third index not value 2
///for the segmentedView in swiftUI, we need to add the modifier for it in the PickerView.
///The text in the pickerView will presented on the segmentedView text
///We use computed properties for the sake of calculation in SwiftUI in most of the cases.
